## VS Code

The text editor we'll be using in this course is called **VS Code**; it was
developed by the Microsoft team, and is highly extensible.

**Note: From this point forward you will open Atom from the command line** with `code <path_of_file_or_dir_to_open>`


### VS Code Add-Ons

Open VS Code, which you should have already installed and go to **Code** > **Preferences** > **Extensions**:

In the search bar, search for and install the following extensions:

- Live Server
- ES Lint
- Prettier Code Formatter
- Auto Rename Tag
- Auto Close Tag
- VS Code Icons
- Git Link
- Git Lens
- Bracket Pair Colorizer
- Path Intellisense
